Hello Fibonnaci
================

This sample is a sample app, created from a [step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tutorials/using-with-xplat-cli)
for creating .NET Core Console Applications. 

Key Features
------------

The app runs a Fiboncci sequence, and output the next Fibonacci number, based on the lagic in the main Program.cs file.

Build and Run
-------------

To build and run the sample, type the following command:

`dotnet run`

`dotnet run` builds the sample and runs the output assembly. It implicitly calls `dotnet restore` on .NET Core 2.0 and later versions. If you're using a .NET Core 1.x SDK, you first have to call `dotnet restore` yourself.
